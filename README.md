[!NOTE]
This doesn't work anymore since Reddit turned off the free API.

This is a webapp I made to make using reddit on my desktop more enjoyable. It uses the Reddit rest API to make an alternative frontend of r/YoutubeHaiku 
that remembers the posts I've watched and allows me to hide them. My mobile reddit client allows me to do this and it made sense that this should be a thing, but it wasn't,
so I made it.

This project uses CSS Grid template areas, the async/Promise Fetch API and localStorage, which are all concepts I hadn't fully explored until now and I had a lot of fun learning
how to use them to build this thing.
